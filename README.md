Created a Workout tracker using the provided boiler plate.  



# Assingment Feedback

Personally I am still struggling with API routes.  One sucessfull thing I have been able to do is console log the response of the API. I can see what data is being sent and then I am able to correct the response in order for the app to function correcly.
